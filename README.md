To open patch properly you need to download SPAT5 from IRCAM ( itâ€™s free) https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/spat/

- designing and implementation of custom viewer that replaces the CPU intensive viewer of Spat5 with a viewer based on the Node objekt
- ![Custom-viewer](./media/Custom-viewer.png)

- ![Nodes-connected-SourceXY](./media/Nodes-connected-SourceXY.png)
- The number of Nodes should represent the number af active channels in the patch, this was dont by using the "r routePopulate" which tells how many samples is loaded into the patch.
- ![custom-viewer-dynamicNodes](./media/custom-viewer-dynamicNodes.png)

- to make it more dynamic when the patch is loaded no nodes are shown, but as soon as samples are loaded the corresponding number of nodes will show in the custom viewer.
